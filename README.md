## Abstract
Binary comparators, which are heavily used in digital circuits, have interconnect complexity and associated overheads such as power-delay product (PDP), parasitics, and heat hotspots. Ternary logic, or base-3, is a promising alternative that reduces interconnect complexity and improves reliability. This proposal designs and implements a scalable, low-power, and high-speed ternary comparator.
